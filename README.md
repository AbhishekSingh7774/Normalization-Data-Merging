# Normalization-Data-Merging
In this example, we have four datasets: two datasets from two different hypothetical clinics, "clinic1" and "clinic2" which diagnose patients with a novel device that takes many measurements. The final goal is to see if they have a particular disease or not. Measurements taken from patients in the two clinics are presented in dataframes df_1 and df_c2. We also have an inspection log, recorded in df_3 and df_4, for the devices used in "clinic1" and "clinic2," where many variables from the device are measured.
Two of these variables, 'R1' and 'R3', are believed to affect the readings taken from the patients. The df_1 and df_2 datasets are labelled with an actual diagnosis of whether the patient had the disease or not, and the goal is to predict the existence of the disease based on the measurements taken from the patients. Since the variables of the devices, measured in inspection, affects the measurements taken from patients in clinics, they should also be considered. Here are the data frames:
